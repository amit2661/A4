		Chosen subtheme: Human Development Indicators, 1960–2020 (Social Development)
    <h2>Proposition: The world is steadily progressing toward a healthier, 
		more educated, and socially just society, with increasing 
		economic opportunities, and overall well-being.</h2>

		<section style="text-align: justify;">
      <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>
				<img src="visual1.jpg" alt="" style="width: 1200px; height: auto;"/>
				<figcaption>
					The world is making undeniable progress: Rising school enrollment and literacy rates, declining child labor, increasing female political representation, and higher life expectancy all signal a healthier, more educated, and socially just society.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale: Small multiples have been used to tell a comprehensive 
				story about the different aspects of social development. Simple graphs with minimalist elements have been used with 
				carefully chosen indicators which show improvement in the lives of youth, children and female.
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>RATIONALE_1</li> Use of Color for Pre-Attentive Processing.<br>
				Score: 1.5 (Earnest but slightly biased).<br>
				The use of green for increasing trends (positive) and red for declining trends (negative) leverages pre-attentive processing, allowing viewers to quickly grasp key trends without conscious effort. This aligns with the principles of visual pop-out discussed in class.<br>
				Alternative Considered: A monochrome color scheme, but it would have reduced the immediate visual impact. The chosen approach enhances the persuasive effect.
				<li>RATIONALE_2</li> Position Encoding for Accuracy.<br>
				Score: 2 (Fully Earnest).<br>
				Rationale: Using position on a common scale for multiple indicators improves comparability and readability. This choice ensures that viewers can accurately compare trends in literacy, school enrollment, and child employment rates over time.<br>
				Alternative Considered: Using a stacked area chart, but it would have distorted perception by making trends harder to compare.
				<li>RATIONALE_3</li> Selection of 2018 for Peak Representation.<br>
				Score: 0.5 (Mildly Biased).<br>
				Rationale: The choice of 2018, when women’s parliamentary representation was at its highest, presents an optimistic snapshot of gender equality. While technically accurate, it filters out fluctuations in other years, potentially misleading viewers into thinking the trend is more consistent than it is.<br>
				Alternative Considered: Using an animated time series, but it would dilute the persuasive impact by showing variability.
				<li>RATIONALE_4</li>Omission of Some African & Smaller Countries for Readability.<br>
				Score: -1 (Somewhat Deceptive).<br>
				Rationale: Omitting countries with low female labor force participation improves readability but also removes important counterexamples. This aligns with Gestalt principles of simplicity (pragnänz), helping users focus on larger trends without clutter.<br>
				Alternative Considered: Including all countries, but that would have reduced clarity and weakened the positive narrative.
				<li>RATIONALE_5</li>Truncated Y-Axis (40-75) to Exaggerate Increase in Life Expectancy.<br> 
				Score: -1.5 (Somewhat Deceptive).<br>
				Rationale: The truncated axis makes small increases appear larger, subtly exaggerating the rate of improvement (Stevens’ Power Law). This manipulation enhances the persuasive impact but could be misleading to viewers unfamiliar with axis distortions.<br>
				Alternative Considered: A full y-axis scale, but it made the increase appear less dramatic.
				<li>RATIONALE_6</li> Cartoon of a Happy Society to Reinforce Message.<br>
				Score: -0.5 (Mildly Deceptive).<br>
				Rationale: The cartoon adds an emotional appeal that subtly biases the viewer toward a positive interpretation (Gestalt Common Fate). While it doesn’t manipulate data, it frames the information in a way that influences perception.<br>
				Alternative Considered: A neutral design, but it lacked the same psychological impact.

      <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>
		<img src="visual2.jpeg" alt="" style="width: 1200px; height: auto;"/>
		<figcaption>
			Despite claims of progress, deep inequalities and crises persist: Refugee populations is on a surge, youth unemployment remains high in many nations, and women continue to be underrepresented in government—even in large democracies.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>RATIONALE_1</li>Use of a Reference Population (Canada’s 2020 Population) for Context.<br>
				Score: 1 (Mostly Earnest, but Contextual Framing).<br>
				Rationale: Adding Canada’s 2020 population (35M) as a reference point provides the reader with a relatable scale comparison, making the refugee numbers feel larger and more overwhelming. This aligns with Magnitude Estimation principles (Stevens’ Power Law), as people tend to underestimate absolute numbers unless given a point of comparison.<br>
				Alternative Considered: Using the US population, but it would have made the refugee numbers appear less severe.
				<li>RATIONALE_2</li>Stacking Refugee Data by Region to Exaggerate the Sense of Crisis.<br>
				Score: -1 (Somewhat Deceptive).<br>
				Rationale: A stacked area chart visually amplifies the increase by accumulating multiple refugee populations. This makes the growth appear larger than if plotted separately (Area Encoding), subtly exaggerating the crisis. Additionally, including "Fragile & Conflict-Affected" regions without clear distinction blurs categorization, making the increase seem even broader.<br>
				Alternative Considered: A line chart per region, but it would have de-emphasized the overall upward trend.
				<li>RATIONALE_3</li>Selective Filtering of “Commonly Known” Countries & Adding US, India, and China for Contrast.<br>
				Score: -1.5 (Deceptive Framing).<br>
				Rationale: By intentionally selecting countries that are commonly known, the chart ensures reader recognition, increasing the emotional impact (Selective Attention). Including India, China, and the US (with much lower unemployment) strengthens the illusion that even powerful economies are struggling with youth unemployment. However, this selection omits other countries with worse statistics, making the data appear more selective than it is.<br>
				Alternative Considered: Using all countries, but that would dilute the impact of well-known cases and too long.
				<li>RATIONALE_4</li>Inclusion of animation to reinforce narrative of title.<br>
				Score: -0.5 (Mildly Deceptive).<br>
				Rationale: Horizontal bars allow for the inclusion of a cartoon character representing wandering, unemployed youth, subtly reinforcing the narrative that these individuals are lost or struggling. This plays into Gestalt Common Fate principles, where visual grouping affects perception.<br>
				<li>RATIONALE_5</li>Reverse Color Scale to Highlight 0% Representation.<br>
				Score: -1 (Somewhat Deceptive).<br>
				Rationale: Reversing the usual "better = darker" color scheme intensifies the perception of injustice (Visual Pop-Out – Color Encoding). By making 0% representation appear in dark brown, it immediately draws attention to the worst cases, making them appear more alarming than the rest of the dataset.<br>
				Alternative Considered: A standard color gradient (lighter for worse values), but it wouldn’t have created as strong of a negative impression.
				<li>RATIONALE_6</li>Choosing 25% as the Cutoff to ensure the US is Included.<br>
				Score: -2 (Deliberately Deceptive).<br>
				Rationale: The 25% threshold was specifically chosen to include the US in the "problem" category, making the issue feel more widespread. This exploits category grouping to frame the data in a way that maximizes perceived severity.<br>
				Alternative Considered: A 20% threshold, but that would have excluded the US, weakening the argument.

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>Designing persuasive visualizations required balancing clarity, 
		accuracy, and contextual impact, which made it difficult to differntiate between 
		effective storytelling and misleading representation. 
		The process was straightforward when structuring narratives around 
		clear trends, such as rising literacy rates and increasing life 
		expectancy, but challenging when selectively framing data to refute
		the proposition. What surprised me most was how subtle design 
		choices—like adjusting axis scales, filtering data, and using effective 
		titles—could dramatically shift perception without altering raw data.
		Animation was also emotionally helpful.
		This underscored how visualization is not just about presenting data but also shaping interpretation.
		<br>
		Through this exercise, my understanding of ethical analysis and visualization evolved. 
		Ethical visualization is not just about truthfulness in numbers, 
		but also honesty in framing, omission, and selection of indicators. Some 
		persuasive choices, like emphasizing meaningful trends with 
		intuitive encodings, feel acceptable. Others, like truncating axes
		to exaggerate effects or selectively filtering countries to 
		distort global patterns, cross into misleading territory, even if
		technically defensible. The boundary is not always clear-cut—if 
		a visualization subtly leads viewers toward an interpretation
		they wouldn't reach otherwise, it becomes ethically questionable. 
		Ultimately, this process made me feel responsibile of 
		data storytellers to balance persuasion with integrity—ensuring 
		that even when I frame arguments, I do so in a way that respects 
		the reader’s ability to draw informed conclusions.</p>
